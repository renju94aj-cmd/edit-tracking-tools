description=Edit Tracking Tools is a lightweight and robust QGIS plugin designed for digitizing teams and GIS production workflows.

It separates edit tracking from normal QGIS editing to avoid performance issues when working with multiple layers.

Main Features:
 - Manual Auto Edit toggle (tracking enabled only when user chooses)
 - Automatic recording of edited features and edit dates
 - Popup reminder when editing previously tracked layers without Auto Edit
 - Create and initialize edited fields
 - Mark selected features as edited
 - Update edit dates using calendar
 - Remove NULL geometries
 - Select NULL in edited attributes
 - Live statistics dock with date filter

Ideal for building updates, parcel digitization, and daily QC monitoring.
